The docs curently need Python 3.11 to compile node-sass.
Create a .venv with `uv venv --seed --python 3.11` and activate it before installing the dependencies via yarn install.

But don't bother as direnv should set that up for you automatically. 

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
